## **Training Documentation Feedback (SOP #7)**

**Role:** Backend Developer Intern

Based on my experience completing the training and reinforcement quizzes, below is my feedback using the **star rating system (max 5 stars)**.
The **reinforcement quizzes gradually increase in difficulty**, starting from **basic definitions and concepts**, moving toward **practical and applied backend scenarios**, which helps solidify understanding.

---

### **1. Python Training** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Reason:**

- Starts from basic concepts like variables, loops, and functions
- Reinforcement quiz begins with definitions and syntax understanding
- Gradually moves to OOP, error handling, and real-world logic
- Well aligned for backend foundations

**Improvement Suggestion:**

- Can add more backend-oriented examples (API data handling, file processing)

---

### **2. PostgreSQL Training** ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆

**Reason:**

- Covers schema design, queries, joins, and indexing
- Reinforcement quiz starts from simple SELECT statements
- Progresses to joins, performance, indexing, and transactions
- Very relevant for backend development

**Improvement Suggestion:**

- Add more query-optimization and real production debugging cases
- Include more examples with EXPLAIN / ANALYZE

---

### **3. Django Training** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Reason:**

- Explains MTV architecture clearly
- Reinforcement quiz starts from definitions (views, models, middleware)
- Gradually increases to authentication, performance, and design questions
- Strong alignment with backend API and service development

**Improvement Suggestion:**

- Add more REST API and production deployment scenarios

---

### **4. GitHub Training** ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆

**Reason:**

- Covers repositories, commits, branching, and collaboration
- Reinforcement questions start with basics and move to workflows
- Useful for backend team collaboration

**Improvement Suggestion:**

- Include more real-world examples on PR reviews and conflict resolution

---

### **5. DLT Training** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Reason:**

- Reinforcement starts from basic pipeline concepts
- Gradually increases to schema evolution, incremental loads, and scaling
- Very backend-oriented and practical
- Encourages correct data engineering and system thinking

**Improvement Suggestion:**

- Provide one complete end-to-end reference project

---

### **6. Azure Training** ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆

**Reason:**

- Covers core cloud concepts relevant to backend systems
- Reinforcement begins with basic services understanding
- Progresses toward deployment, security, and access control

**Improvement Suggestion:**

- Add backend-focused deployment pipelines and monitoring examples

---

### **Overall Feedback**

- Reinforcement quizzes are **well structured**
- Difficulty **gradually increases from basic understanding → applied backend use cases**
- Helps reinforce not just syntax but **system design and reasoning**
- Very effective for backend-focused interns

---

### **Additional Improvement Idea**

- A **backend capstone flow** combining Django + PostgreSQL + DLT + Azure
- More real-world failure scenarios and debugging exercises
